Calendar using HTML, JS and CSS

The user is able to move between months and is able to click a date cell and enter a cell and book an event
this is done by entering an event name and selecting a starting and end time

future additions:
fully implementing a system that stores entered data that persists after page refresh
showing a stored event in its proper date cell
further styling of the title and cells
